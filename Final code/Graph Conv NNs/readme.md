GAT_model : This model is using Graph Attention Neural Network and specially using  GlobalAttention,GATConv of torch_geometric.nn library in pytorch. This network has couple GATconv layer ahd pooling layer, and then output layer which is Linear layer.

GCN_model : This model is using Graph Convolution Neural Network which is classic and very common method for training. We are going to compare to other two models how different result will have.

TransformerConv_model : This model is using Transformer Convolution Neural Network which is pretty new method. As a result, this model has the best result from these 3 models.
