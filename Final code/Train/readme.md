Train three different models. we are using all same dataset and everything same but just use different method of training. and kfold_split is for splitting data into train(80%), test(10%), validate(10%)  
Basically GCN is class method for training also we are using two more different type of Neural Network which are Graph Attention NN, Transformer Convolution NN to compare which one is the best.
